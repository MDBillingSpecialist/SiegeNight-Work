description=Siege Night turns your base into a battleground. Every few nights, the dead march on your position from a single direction — wave after wave, growing stronger as the night goes on. Build your walls. Stock your ammo. Survive until dawn.

description=Built for fortress defense. Solo or multiplayer.

description=[*] [b]Wave Cycles[/b] — WAVE → TRICKLE → BREAK phases that escalate through the night. Each wave hits harder than the last.
description=[*] [b]Directional Attacks[/b] — Every siege comes from a random compass direction. You can't fortify everything.
description=[*] [b]Dawn Survival[/b] — Make it to sunrise and your character announces the kill count. The siege panel tracks everything.
description=[*] [b]20+ Sandbox Options[/b] — Tune siege frequency, zombie count, wave intensity, special zombie rates, mini-horde thresholds, and more across 3 sandbox pages.
description=[*] [b]Kill Tracking[/b] — Per-siege and lifetime kill stats in your character info panel with full siege history.

description=Between siege nights, your activity generates [b]heat[/b]. Running generators, firing guns, hoarding loot, driving vehicles — it all attracts attention.

description=Push your luck too far and you'll hear: [i]"Something's attracting them from the south..."[/i]
description=
description=The heat system scales with player count in multiplayer, so bigger groups draw bigger problems.
